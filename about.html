                <p>
                    WOK – World of Kitchen – was born out of a passion for Asian cuisine and a deep appreciation for the cultural stories behind every dish.
                    Our mission is to bring the essence of authentic Asian cooking into your home, one recipe at a time. Whether you're craving the rich spices of Indian curry,
                    the balanced harmony of Japanese sushi, or the fiery street foods of Thailand, WOK offers carefully curated recipes, cooking tips, and cultural insights
                    to guide you on a flavorful journey across Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe food is more than sustenance — it’s a bridge between cultures. At WOK, we celebrate diversity through culinary traditions and invite you
                    to explore the vibrant flavors, colors, and stories from kitchens across the continent.
